# odin-recipes

the goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website, with HTML, that will consist of: 

- a main index page containing links to a few recipes
- several recipe pages, accessible via links on the main index page

the skills I will have demonstrated after completion are as follows:

- proper use of semantic HTML elements and tags, prioritizing accessibility

- working with text primitives like headings, paragraphs, and simple style modifications. 

- use of unordered and ordered lists where applicable

- applying relative linking for website navigation

- displaying images 

- writing well structured commit messages
