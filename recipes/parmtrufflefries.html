    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            French fries coated in truffle oil and Parmesan cheese are simply heavenly! They were served at one of my favorite brewpubs, and I knew I had to recreate them at home.
        </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>peanut oil for frying</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons truffle oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup finely shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons minced fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            Cut potatoes into French fry shapes, about 3/8-inch wide and thick, using a mandoline or a knife. Soak potatoes in a large bowl of cold water for about 30 minutes. Drain and pat potatoes dry with a clean towel.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            Heat oil in a deep-fryer or deep saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
        </ol>
        <ol>
            Gently lower 1/4 of the potatoes into the hot oil and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Transfer cooked potatoes to a clean towel using a slotted spoon. Repeat frying with remaining potatoes.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            Heat the same oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry potatoes again, working in batches, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer fries to a clean kitchen towel using a slotted spoon.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            Place fries in a bowl and drizzle truffle oil over warm fries; season with Parmesan cheese, parsley, and sea salt.
        </ol>
